        <strong>What is Full Stack web Development?</strong>
        <p>Full Stack Web Development is akin to being a Swiss Army knife in the web development world. It involves working on both the front-end (the visible part of a website that users interact with) and the back-end (the server-side that users don't see) of web applications. Full stack developers possess a versatile skill set that allows them to create a fully functional web application from scratch.</p>
        <strong>Front-End Development</strong>
        <p>Front-end development is all about the user interface and user experience. It's the part of the web that you see and interact with on your browser. Front-end developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the layout, design, and interactivity of a website. They ensure that the website is accessible, responsive, and visually appealing across different devices and browsers.</p>
        <strong>Back-end Development</strong>
        <p>Back-end development is the backbone of a website, focusing on server, database, and application logic. Back-end developers work with server-side languages like Python, Ruby, Java, and Node.js to build the architecture that powers the site. They manage databases, ensure data security, and handle user authentication. The back-end is where all the data processing happens, and it's crucial for the functionality of a website.</p>
        <strong>✨The Full Stack✨</strong>
        <p>A full stack developer is proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies. They can build a website or an application from the ground up, handling everything from the design of user interfaces to server and database management. Their broad skill set includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Frontend Languages</em>: HTML, CSS, JacaScript</li>
            <li><em>Backend Languages</em>: Python, Ruby, Java, Node.js</li>
            <li><em>Databases</em>: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
            <li>Version Control/Git</li>
            <li>Testing & Debugging</li>
            <li>Understanding of good design principles and user experience</li>
        </ul>
